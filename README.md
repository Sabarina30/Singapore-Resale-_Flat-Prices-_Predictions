# Singapore_Resale_prices_ Predictions
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the resale prices of flats in Singapore. This predictive model will be based on historical data of resale flat transactions, and it aims to assist both potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.There are many factors that can affect resale prices, such as location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration. 
## Work Flow
           Data Collection and Preprocessing
           Feature Engineering
           Model selection and Training
           Model Evaluation
           Testing and validation

The Resale Flat Prices dataset has five distinct CSV files, each representing a specific time period. These time periods are 1990 to 1999, 2000 to 2012, 2012 to 2014, 2015 to 2016, and 2017 onwards. Therefore, it is essential to merge the five distinct CSV files into ansingle dataset.The data will be converted and any required cleaning and pre-processing procedures will be carried out. Relevant features from the dataset, including town, flat type, storey range, floor area, flat model, and lease commence date will be extracted. Any additional features that may enhance prediction accuracy will also be created.The objective of this study is to construct a machine learning regression model that utilizes the decision tree regressor to accurately forecast the continuous variable 'resale_price'.
